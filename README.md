The missing control point for autonomous systems.

In physical systems, control doesn’t only come from formal rules.

It comes from small, informal moments:
a second look,
a hesitation,
a pause before passing something on.

These aren’t designed.
But they act as a buffer.

In manufacturing, they show up as:
machine cycles,
handover points,
informal checks.

They slow things down just enough to catch drift.

Agents removed these for speed.

What remains is fast execution —
without the moment that corrects the system.

This reintroduces that moment.

The Problem

When systems speed up, these are the first things to disappear.

People trust the system more.
Or move things through to keep flow.

What remains is fast execution,
without the moment that catches drift.

Individually correct.
Systemically wrong.

Executed in sequence, each action looks reasonable.

Executed at speed, they drift.

⸻

The Fix

We don’t add friction everywhere.

We restore the missing moment.

A lightweight interruption,
triggered only when signals suggest drift.

Not a blocker.
A control point.

Example

A single action:

task = {
“tool”: “api”,
“cmd”: “place_order”,
“confidence”: 0.65,
“cost”: 18000
}

Individually, it looks correct.

Now apply the interruption:

def should_interrupt(task):
if task[“tool”] == “bash” and “rm -rf” in task[“cmd”]:
return True, “Destructive command”

if task["confidence"] < 0.7 and task["cost"] > 500:
    return True, "Low confidence, high cost"

return False, None

interrupt, reason = should_interrupt(task)

if interrupt:
print(f”PAUSED: {reason}”)

Output:

PAUSED: Low confidence, high cost

⸻

At small scale, this is nothing.

At scale, this is the difference between a normal system
and one that drifts without correction.

⸻

Why it matters

No single action is wrong.

The system drifts.

This brings back the moment where it can correct itself.
